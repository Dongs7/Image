Select provided image file, then the program will display an original image file.
The program will also display grayscale, dithered image and image's histogram.

Three provided images will be displayed, and also HDR image will be created from the three provided images.

Part2-1 
Part2 program will compress the three image files and create a file with .thr extension.
This program will decompress .thr image file and display images.
Was trying to build own compress method, but the method did not work as it should be.
